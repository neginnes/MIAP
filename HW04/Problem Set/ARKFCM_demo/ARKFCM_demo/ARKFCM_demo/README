This demo includes the following files:

ARKFCM.m:      The ARKFCM algorithm main function
PixWgt.m:      The function that calculates the weight for each pixel based
               on the local variation coefficient
distARKFCM.m:  The function that calculates the distance between cluster
               centers and the pixels using GRBF Kernel
gaussKernel.m: The function that calculates the Gaussian RBF kernel used as distance metric
kerWidth.m:    The function that calculates the kernel base (sigma) for GRBF Kernel Function
demo.m:        The demo that runs the main function with different images
noise.mat:     Different MR images corrupted with different level of noises
